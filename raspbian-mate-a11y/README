These scripts are for installing an accessible console and the Mate desktop on a Raspbian Lite 
image.

It uses the OMX code developed by me to provide stutter-free speech in the console with speakup, and 
a USB audio dongle to provide stutter-free speech with Orca in the desktop.

The scripts are named with numbers in front of the main part of the name to make it obvious in which 
order they must be run.

The scripts are:

00-update.sh

Perform an update to the package cache before doing anything else.

10-install-ilctts.sh

The above installs the OMX library used by piespeakup, installed in the next script.

20-install-piespeakup.sh

Installs piespeakup, which is a fork of espeakup which uses my OMX library.

30-install-lite-mate.sh

Installs the Mate desktop, Orca, and xinit.

40-install-lightdm.sh

Installs the lightdm greeter. Run if you want to start the desktop login automatically, rather than 
using startx.

50-create-xinitrc.sh

Run this script to create your .xinitrc file if you have not installed a greeter like lightdm and 
want to start Mate by typing `startx`.

60-a11y-switches.sh

Toggles the necessary switches which will cause Orca and supporting things to start when the desktop 
starts.

70-save-memory.sh

Do some tweaks which will save memory, like removing icons from menus and buttons.

80-remove-unused-sd-modules.sh

Remove unused speech-dispatcher modules, again to save memory.
