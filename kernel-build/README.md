# kernel-build

In here is a script called _kcc_ for building a Raspberry Pi kernel and modules.

Also, in the _ctng_ directory are a pair of directories containing the necessary _.config_ files for 
creating a cross-compiler tool-chain for either or both flavours of Raspberry Pi; _armv6_ for the 
original Pi, or _armv7_ for the Pi version 2.
