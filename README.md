## In this repo

A bit misnamed as there is stuff in here which is generic or applicable to other SBCs.

## a11y-configs/

In here there is a mechanism I have called the 'sausage-machine'.

It is a mechanism for running multiple scripts in a controlled order for doing complex 
configurations.

## bash/

A mish-mash of stuff.

## file-conv-utils/

Mostly music file conversion or CD burning scripts.

## make-rpi-arch/

In here is a script for downloading the root file-system of an Arch system from archlinuxarm.org and 
making a full Arch Linux image file for writing to an SD card.

Works for either ARMv6 or ARMv7.

A bash script called kcc for doing a kernel cross-compile.
