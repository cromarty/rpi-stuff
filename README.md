rpi-stuff
=========

* imgtool/

In this directory is a tool for creating and mounting .img files, including mounting existing 
Raspberry Pi images, creating new (empty) ones and transferring files from one to the other.

* kernel-build/

Stuff relating to cross-compiling a Pi kernel.

* make-rpi-arch/

A script for making Arch Linux images for the Raspberry Pi.

* sausage-machine/

In here is a mechanism I created for running multiple scripts in sequence. It is a bit out of date 
and needs to either be scrapped or re-written but some of the scripts contain stuff I refer to 
occasionally so I have left it here.
