The sausage-machine script.

About the sausage-machine:

While I was attempting to get some accessibility tools to work on the Pi, I 
found myself running the same configuration tasks over and over again.  So I 
wrote this mechanism, which I have christened the 'Sausage-machine'.

What this does is to execute a defined series of scripts in a 
controlled order.  An example of what these scripts might do is:

1.  Install some packages in preparation.
2.  Get some source files.
3.  Build the sources.
4.  Create packages from the builds.
5.  Install the created packages.
6.  Run some configuration tasks.
7.  Tidy up behind itself.

The script collections have been grouped into what I am calling 'sausage-packs'.

See the README in, and sub-directories of, ../a11y-configs.

Creating a 'sausage-pack':

All the scripts in my sausage-packs begin with a three digit number and end with 
'.sh'.  The numeric prefix ensures the scripts run in the correct order and the 
script 'sm.sh' will glob all files which match the pattern +([0-9])*.sh

If you need an explanation of the logic of the name, maybe because in your 
culture you are not sure what a sausage is, read on.  If you're a vegetarian, 
quick, close the file...

A sausage in this context is a cylindrical meat product which contains either 
good meat, or ground offal, or a combination of both and other material like 
rusk or bread crumbs.  They are made by filling long 'skins' typically formed 
from the cleaned intestines of a pig.  As sausages are filled the skins are 
twisted to form a characteristic string of sausages, where each sausage is a few 
centimetres in length.

Machines which mechanise this process produce sausages in a long string, hence 
the analogy of running a bunch of scripts in controlled order.

In the UK, sausages are mass produced in packs of approximately half a kilogram, 
containing typically eight sausages still strung together.  Hence 
'sausage-pack'.
