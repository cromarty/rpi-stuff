The Sausage Machine
====================

Note added in December 2016: Most of the code in here is OTBE (overtaken by events). Old and not 
really relevant to what I am doing now but there is still stuff in here I refer to so I leave it 
here.

End of note.

This is a mechanism for running multiple scripts in a controlled sequence.

Using this mechanism it is possible to run a complex configuration in steps.

Written when I was trying to get accessibility tools to run on the Raspberry Pi.

* alarmpi/

'Sausage packs' for Arch Linux for the Pi.

* minibian/

'Sausage Packs' for Minibian.

* raspbian/

'Sausage Packs' for Raspbian.

* talking-arch/

Not actually for the Raspberry Pi.  'Sausage Packs' for Chris Brannan's Talking Arch distro.

* test/

Test stuff.

* generate-run-scripts.sh

Run this to create script in the top-level directory of each 'Sausage Pack'.
