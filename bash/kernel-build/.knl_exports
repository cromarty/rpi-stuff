#
# Put this file in your home directory and in the kernel build scripts and/or in
# your .bashrc file like this:
#
# [[ -f ~/.knl_exports ]] && . ~/.knl_exports
#
# It must appear after you have set the KERNEL_ROOT variable to work properly
#

# These depend on KERNEL_ROOT:
export KERNEL_SRC=${KERNEL_ROOT}/src/
export MODULES_TEMP=${KERNEL_ROOT}/modules
export KERNEL_BUILD=${KERNEL_ROOT}/build

# These don't change from build to build, but
# change CCROOT to the root of where you put the cross-compiler tool-chain:
export CCROOT=/opt/tools
export CCPREFIX=${CCROOT}/arm-bcm2708/arm-bcm2708hardfp-linux-gnueabi/bin/arm-bcm2708hardfp-linux-gnueabi-
export PLATFORM=bcmrpi
