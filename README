Here's what is in this repo:
===========================


Top-level directory

In here there is a shell-script called chmodx-shell-scripts.sh.  This script can 
be executed to recursively set all *.sh scripts in the repo to mode 755.  This 
is here because I have used a combination of Linux and Windows in developeing 
these scripts and Windows git does not preserve the executable flag when a 
branch is pushed from there.

a11y-configs/

This directory contains a mechanism I have called the 'Sausage-machine' and a 
bunch of scripts which can configure a Raspberry Pi running a number of 
different versions of Linux for accessibility.

In here you will find a shell-script called main-menu.sh.  When executed this 
script will present you with a menu of options for configuring your Raspberry Pi 
for accessibility.

Currently it is recommended you start with a fresh install of Raspbian, or 
whichever version of Linux the menu items suggest.  You will find more README 
files in the sub-directories of this directory.

main-menu.sh calls sm.sh, the actual sausage-machine.  I called it 
sausage-machine because it is designed to execute a series of scripts in order.

Note that security purists might be unhappy with the way in which this mechanism 
executes the scripts, but then this is a Raspberry Pi, not a life-support 
machine on a space-ship.
 
bash/

This directory contains a mix of different bash scripts for doing stuff on a 
Raspberry Pi.  The script names should be descriptive enough.  There is also a 
README in this directory which gives more detail.  Most of them relate to Arch 
Linux and some may be useful on a desktop or laptop machine.

notes/

Contains textual notes of my experiences with the Pi.  For my use more than 
yours but you may find them useful.  Don't expect too much order in here, it's a 
bit chaotic.

file-conv-utils/

File conversion utilities.  May contain some scripts not really relevant to the 
Pi.

music-utils/

Various utilities to do with music files.  May contain some scripts not really 
relevant to the Pi.
