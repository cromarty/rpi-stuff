This sausage-pack is designed to configure Arch Linux on the Raspberry Pi to 
incorporate some accessibility tools in the following way:

1.  Compile eSpeak for pulseaudio support incorporating some tweaks to the source code 
to fix latency issues which make the default eSpeak 'stutter' on the RPI.
2.  Compile speech-dispatcher for pulseaudio support and the use of the eSpeak 
synthesiser.
3.  Compile and install speechd-up to connect the SpeakUp console-mode 
screen-reader to speech-dispatcher.
4.  Compile and install pulseaudio.
5.  Install Emacspeak from the AUR.
6.  Install brl-tty to provide Braille output.

Please note that at the time of writing the default Arch ARM distro for the RPI 
does not include a SpeakUp enabled kernel or any of it's modules.  It will be 
necessary to recompile the kernel for SpeakUp support.  The sausage-machine does 
not do this step.
