This sausage-pack is designed to configure Arch Linux for accessibility by:

1.  Compiling eSpeak with latency tweaks which suit the Raspberry Pi.
2.  Installing Emacspeak and it's dependancies.
3.  Installing brl-tty to provide Braille output.
4.  Install espeakup to connect the SpeakUp console-mode screen-reader to 
eSpeak.
5.  Create an ordinary user.
6.  Install some temporary scripts into the new user's directory for use in 
expanding the root file-system of a new card.

Note that at the time of writing the SpeakUp modules were not provided in the 
standard Arch ARM distro for the RPI.  This makes it necessary to compile a new 
kernel and SpeakUp modules.  This job is not done by the sausage-machine and 
will need to be done seperately.
