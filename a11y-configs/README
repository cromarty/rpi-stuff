In this directory:

This directory contains sub-directories which themselves contain 
'sausage-packs' (see ../sausage-machine/README) which will configure a variety 
of different Raspberry Pi versions of Linux to add various accessibility tools.

In addition it contains a script; 'main-menu.sh' which will present to the user 
a menu of Raspberry Pi related sausage-packs to run.

pi-arch/

The pi-arch sub-directory contains sausage-packs which relate to Arch Linux.

raspbian/

The raspbian directory contains packs for configuring accessibility tools on 
Raspbian.

It should be obvious from the structure of these two directories how to set-up 
your own packs of scripts to run with the 'sausage-machine'.
