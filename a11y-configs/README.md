## The Sausage Machine

This is a mechanism for running multiple scripts in a controlled sequence.

Using this mechanism it is possible to run a complex configuration in steps.

Written when I was trying to get accessibility tools to run on the Raspberry Pi.

### alarmpi/

'Sausage packs' for Arch Linux for the Pi.

### minibian/

'Sausage Packs' for Minibian.

### raspbian/

'Sausage Packs' for Raspbian.

### talking-arch/

Not actually for the Raspberry Pi.  'Sausage Packs' for Chris Brannan's Talking Arch distro.

### test/

Test stuff.

### generate-run-scripts.sh*

Run this to create script in the top-level directory of each 'Sausage Pack'.
