This sausage-pack will configure a default installation of Raspbian to add 
accessibility tools in the following way:

1.  Compile eSpeak for pulseaudio support incorporating some latency tweaks which are 
needed on the Pi to stop the speech from stuttering.
2.  Compile speech-dispatcher for pulseaudio support and to use eSpeak.
3.  Compile speechd-up to connect the SpeakUp console-mode screen-reader to 
speech-dispatcher.
4.  Install gnome-orca for GUI accessibility.
5.  Remove unequivicably inaccessible applications such as paint programs 
from Raspbian.

Note that unlike some other Linux distros for the Pi, Raspbian, at the time of 
writing includes the SpeakUp console-mode screen-reader but it is not currently 
enabled by default.
